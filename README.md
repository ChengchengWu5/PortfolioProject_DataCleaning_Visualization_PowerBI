### This projects invovles data cleaning and visualization in Power BI. For data cleaning, it focuses on:

- adding a new column (i.e. the order_processing_time column by subtracting the value from the ship_date column by the corresponding value from 
  the order_date column
- adding new coloumns (i.e. order_month_name and order_year columns) based on the order_date column 
- adding another new column (the employee_name in this case) calculated based on the employee_id column

For data analysis, the project creates new measures (i.e. Total Discount, Total Order, Total Producst, and Total Revenue) using the Data Analysis Expressions 
(DAX) formula language, such as SUMX and COUNTX.
